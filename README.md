# Tetris_Mips
HKUST comp2611 Computer Organisation Programming Assignment

!!! You must download the Mars Simulator provided here to run the Mips code to play the game. Other simulator may not be compatible with it.

1 Introduction
In this project, you will use MIPS assembly program to implement a (modified and
simpler) Tetris Game.
Tetris is a puzzle video game created by Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in
1984. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms.

In Tetris, players complete lines
by moving differently shaped pieces, called “tetrominoes”, which descend onto the
playing field. (In what follows, we call “tetrominoes” as “blocks”.) The completed spaces. The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. The
longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be.
In this project, we implement a simpler version of Tetris.
